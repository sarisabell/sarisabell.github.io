## Why am I posting this

Well, in this case I am not sure if the post needs any explanation... As most are aware of, ML (a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI)) is already everywhere around us (chatbots are run with ML, some translation machines (e.g. [deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator)), the newsfeeds that are presented to you, ...) and everyone is talking about it... So surely, it won't harm to learn something about it yourself.

## What is Machine Learning actually?

ML is a subset of AI[^1] 

## How can it be applied in water treatment sciences

Application fields are various:
- Predictive Maintenance (Processes, Equipment, ... )
- Prediction of Water Qualities according to certain Input Parameters
- Optimization of Treatment Processes
- Simulation of Treatment Processes (Generating a Digital Twin)

{% include info.html text="If you can think of other further fields, please let me know! :)" %}

## First example for application of ML to water data


m & p value prediction? prediction of other parameters? prediction of water qualities after treatment step
