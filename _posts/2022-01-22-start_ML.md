## Why am I posting this

Well, in this case I am not sure if the post needs any explanation... As most are aware of, ML (a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI)) is already everywhere around us (chatbots are run with ML, some translation machines (e.g. [deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator)), the newsfeeds that are presented to you, ...) and everyone is talking about it... So surely, it won't harm to learn something about it yourself.

## What is Machine Learning actually?

ML is a subset of AI[^1] 

## How can it be applied in water treatment sciences

Application fields are various:
- Predictive Maintenance (Processes, Equipment, ...)
- Prediction of Water Qualities according to certain Input Parameters
- Optimization of Treatment Processes
- Simulation of Treatment Processes (Generating a Digital Twin)

## First example for application of ML to water data


m & p value prediction? prediction of other parameters? prediction of water qualities after treatment step

### Creating your first model 






ekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:

## Lists

Here's a list:

- item 1
- item 2

And a numbered list:

1. item 1
1. item 2

## Boxes and stuff

> This is a quotation

{% include alert.html text="You can include alert boxes" %}

...and...

{% include info.html text="You can include info boxes" %}

## Images

![](/images/logo.png "fast.ai's logo")

## Code

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```
